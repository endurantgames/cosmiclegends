# Skills {#toc-skills .breakbefore}

Outside of a fight, your hero has one or more Skills from their 
civilian life -- from their secret identity, their profession 
before their secret origin, or their advanced heroic training. 

::::::::::::: {.twocolumn .skill-column-list} ::::::::::::::::::
The Skills are:

- Academic
- Artist
- Bureaucrat
- Criminal
- Deputy
- Engineer
- Explorer
- Hacker
- Historian
- Investigator
- Journalist
- Lawyer
- Mystic
- Performer
- Physician
- Pilot
- Politician
- Scientist
- Socialite
- Spy
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you create your hero, you can pick two or more skills as
determined by your class, which may also give additional skills.

## Using Skills

When you make a roll that could be affected by one of your Skills,
you add a number of dice to the dice pool equal to the current Volume.

If you don't have a Skill, you don't add any extra dice to the pool.

## Skill Descriptions

The skills in []{.gamename} are listed below, along with 3 to 5 
suggestions how you could use the skill with your hero's Approaches,
and consequences the Editor can propose on an Edge Success.

### Losing Health or Might

If you lose Health, you can describe how you injured yourself while
using your skill. Losing Might generally means becoming tired, possibly
from stress or overwork.

You can only choose a consequence for an Edge Success that injures
another hero with the permission of that hero's player.
