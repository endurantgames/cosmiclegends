When you want your hero to use their powers, you pick one Power Word
and explain how you're using that power.

A Power Display doesn't cost any Might points, and has two effects:

1. You can add one die to a relevant roll
2. You can explain how your hero is able make a roll

After you use a Power Word in a Power Display, it goes on Cooldown
until the start of the next Hero Phase, and you can't use it until then.

::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For example, if a villain is flying over the city, you could describe it
as a Power Display using your Power Word of Flight when you take to 
the skies to throw a punch. 

If you don't have Flight as a Power Word, but you have Line, your
Display could describe how you hook your swingline onto a nearby 
skyscraper to deliver two boots to the face.
