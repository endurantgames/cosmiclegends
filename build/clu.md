## Ethos {#toc-ethos .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} revolves around the following three pillars:

### Self Expression {#toc-ethos-self-expression}

The Power Word system and Crisis system are intentionally built to 
give players freedom to engage with problems in their own style. 
[]{.gamename} lets you be yourself, and do things in your own way, 
without being left behind by your team.

### Teamwork {#toc-ethos-teamwork}

[]{.gamename} is written to encourage the players to work 
together. Whether you're combining your powers to use Power Combos
or using your skills to overcome an opponent together, heroes in 
[]{.gamename} succeed or fail as a team.

### Difficult Choices {#toc-ethos-difficult-choices}

The Edge Success system is built so that you have the freedom 
to choose failure. The Crisis system is built so that you can 
choose to take big hits. Good things and bad things happen to
your hero, and both of these are in the your hands to choose. 
The Editor’s job is to give you those difficult choices.

### [No Fascists]{#soapbox-no-fascists}

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) or something.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### "Four-Color" {#toc-preface-four-color}

The term "four-color" refers to the printing process used
in comics that led to most heroes having bold, primary
colors for their uniforms, their bodies, their worlds.

One example is Superman's hair having *blue* overtones --
this was meant to display his hair as a lustrous black
but the capabilities time precluded that.

*Our* use of the term "four-color" doesn't refer to the 
print process for this game but instead to the general tone 
of late Silver Age and Bronze Age comics -- when primary-color 
superheroes of the '50s and '60s met the social issues of 
the '70s and '80s.


### The Ages of Comics {#toc-preface-ages}

American comics fans and scholars divide the history of 
comics into four loosely defined "ages": the Golden Age, the
Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Modern Age.

[The Golden Age]{#toc-preface-ages-golden} - 1938 to 1956 

:   The Golden Age started with the introduction of Superman
    and the concept of superheroes in general.
    Many of the most well-known characters, such as Wonder Woman 
    and Captain America, were created during the Golden Age.
  
    Some comics in the Golden Age were simplistic fun, while others 
    featured dark themes, shocking gore, and vile villains.  A lot of 
    Nazis were punched in those comics, which is always a good thing.
  
    Unfortunately, racism and sexism often were major themes in Golden 
    Age comics; examples of anti-Asian hatred are all too easy to find.

[The Silver Age]{#toc-preface-ages-silver} - 1956 to circa 1970 

:   The Silver Age began when DC Comics created new versions of the Flash, 
    Green Lantern, and others, then the Justice League of America. 
    Marvel responded by creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, 
    the Avengers, the Hulk, the X-Men, and more.
  
    The Silver Age also saw the creation of the Comics Code Authority,
    a self-censorship board created in the wake of a moral panic
    over the content of comics.
  
    Superhero comics in the Silver Age followed a long list of 
    restrictions banning everything from "horror" and "gore" 
    to "vampires" and "cannibalism". Heroes always won, villains 
    always lost, and authority figures were portrayed with respect -- 
    at least, that's what the Comics Code demanded.

[The Bronze Age]{#toc-preface-ages-bronze} - ca. 1970 to ca. 1985

:   The Bronze Age is less distinctly defined chronologically, but was 
    a time when comics went through changes: becoming more socially 
    relevant and less restrained by the CCA. More on that later.
  
[The Modern Age]{#toc-preface-ages-modern} - ca. 1985 to present

:   The current age of comics is usually dated to the end of
    DC's *Crisis on Infinite Earths* and Marvel's *Secret Wars*.

    Modern superhero comics often feature antiheroes, complex
    storylines, and mature themes. Many of the older characters
    were revamped to more contemporary versions.

    The CCA also withered away to irrelevancy as the major publishers
    increasingly often published comics without the CCA seal on the cover.

### Influences

#### The Super Friends {#toc-preface-super-friends}

In case you weren't aware, this game is inspired by the 
[Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends)
cartoon show that was on the air from 1973 to 1985 -- also
the years yours truly was age 5 and 16. It's fair to say
the show influenced how I view comics and superheroes
in general.

The first season has an opening monologue where the four 
heroes were "created from the cosmic legends of the universe!"

What on earth does *that* mean?  How exactly was *millionaire playboy 
Bruce Wayne* created from the __cosmic legends of the universe__?!
I've never figured that out, but it does make a great title
for our litle Bronze-Age-inspired, four-color superhero tabletop RPG.



# Brigantia {#setting-brigantia}

- **Occupation:** Graduate student, poet
- **Legal Status:** Citizen of the Republic of Ireland
- **Gender:** female (she/her)
- **Identity:** secret
- **Place of Birth:** Cork, Ireland
- **Marital Status:** single
- **Base of Operations:** Dublin, Ireland; Sun City, U.S.A.
- **Group Affiliation:** Cosmic Legends of the Universe

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

As a child, Sienna MacGowan heard legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann 
from her grandmother, and she claimed the Celtic gods even spoke 
to her in her dreams.

When she grew older, Sienna's dreams faded and she no longer
believed in the mythological aspects of Celtic fables. Instead,
she resolved to prove that the Tuatha Dé Danann were historical
beings as mortal as anyone else. 

Armed with an archaeology degree, Sienna was working late at a 
digsite outside the village of Skryne, when a voice called out to
her, asking why she had forgotten her dreams. The experience
repeated each night, although none save her heard the voice.

Finding no logical explanation for the phenomenon, Sienna replied
to the voice and asked who was speaking. The goddess Brigit appeared
before Sienna, told her she was the Champion of the 
Tuatha Dé Danann, and gifted her with power.


**Powers:**

When Sienna speaks the magic words, *Claidheamh Soluis*, she is
transformed into the superhumanly powerful Champion, Brigantia.
Her powers include flight, wisdom, super-speed, super-strength, 
and projection of light rays from her eyes; in times of great 
need, she can form a sword of blazing light.

# The Grailknight {#setting-grailknight}

- **Gender:** male (he/him)
- **Identity:** public
- **Place of Birth:** Aberffraw, Wales
- **Marital Status:** single

- **Group Affiliation:** Cosmic Legends of the Universe (*founding member*, *reserve member*), Knights of the Round Table (organization defunct), A.L.E.R.T. (reserve operative)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**History:**

Percival Pellinore, the Grailknight, is *the* Percival of myth -- member
of Arthur's Round Table, son of Pellinore, questing knight of the Holy Grail.

Although Percival is reluctant to speak of his past, he has told a few that
he swore an oath to find and recover the Chalice of the Last Supper, and
that he would never rest until he had fulfilled said oath.

Either his unflagging devotion to his vow or the divine nature of his mission
have kept him alive, and no older than middle aged, for centuries. Percival's
legend weaves in and out of history -- surfacing in one war only to disappear
for a century after it and reappearing around the world.

In 1963, over 50 years since his last appearance, Percival joined with other
heroes of the time to repell Xana Mega's Fomorian invasion. Percival's offhand
mention of the Table Round led to the formation of these heroes as a team,
the Cosmic Legends of the Universe.

With a tendency to vanish for weeks or years at a time, Percival is at best
a part-time member of the Cosmic Legends, although whenever evil is ascendent, 
he is an implaccable foe and resourceful ally.


**Powers:**

Sir Percival has only one confirmed power:
immortality. Due to his vows, he's unable to die until he
completes his quest and finds the Grail.


**Weapons:**
